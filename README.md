# *Love, Pixels, and Power-Ups*
### a chaotic tale of two flawed gamers trying (and failing) to level up in love
---
This duo might just be the ultimate example of what happens when romance meets respawn — perfectly imperfect and entertainingly disastrous.

*Main Character GREEN*
1. Thinks "emotional growth" means beating the next boss
2. Still hung up on old save files (aka exes)
3. Gaslights himself into thinking he’s the hero
---
*Love Interest BLUE*
1. Carries more emotional baggage than her power-ups
2. Has an upgrade phase every two weeks — new hair, new vibe
3. Treats commitment like a side quest
